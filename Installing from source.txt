Installing Packages from source in ArchLinux

To install a third-party software package in
Arch Linux access the AUR package repository
page and search for the package you need to install. 
In our case, We are going to install Google
Chrome in our Arch Linux system.

Click on “Download Snapshot” in the right pane under
“Package Actions“. This will download the tarball of Google Chrome 
in your local ‘Downloads’ folder.

Navigate to the ‘Downloads’ folder and extract the tarball

=>       tar -xvf google-chrome.tar.gz


Navigate the newly created google-chrome folder with the cd command

=>       cd google-chrome

To view the directory’s contents, use the ls command.
 Be sure to catch a glance of several files

=>       ls

Next, run the makepkg command

=>       makepkg

The makepkg tool automates the process of converting the source code 
into binaries by acting as a compiler. In this case,
the makepkg command instructs the System to generate a 
native Arch Linux package for Google Chrome.

Inside the snapshot folder, you’ll discover a newly generated
native arch package for Google Chrome.

google-chrome-68.0.3440.106-1-x86_64.pkg.tar.xz

Switch to root user and run the command below to install Google Chrome

=>        pacman -U google-chrome*.tar.gz
